# Accordion

This is my implementation of the Accordion project, which is one of the projects of Sangam Mukherjee's [Build 25 React Projects - Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdHfJVAY-s).

While Mr. Mukherjee focused on teaching React, I'm focusing on practicing what I've learned about Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
